# gemini-in-bq

This repo contains relevant code artifacts and step-by-step user guide on building a demo / exploring Gemini in BigQuery. The demo highlights the power of Gemini, Google's advanced AI model, in BigQuery. By enabling users to search, prepare and analyze data with natural language and a few clicks instead of SQL, Gemini makes data accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical skills . The demo will show how to easily build and orchestrate a data pipeline within BQ Studio, followed by asking questions in plain English, such as "What were the top selling products last quarter?", and Gemini will automatically generate the necessary SQL, retrieve the data, and present it in an easy-to-understand format, including visualizations. This empowers business users to quickly get answers to critical questions, leading to faster and more informed decision-making. Additionally, the demo will cover AI assistance with code generation, completion, explanation and smart recommendations for optimizations within BQ Studio.
